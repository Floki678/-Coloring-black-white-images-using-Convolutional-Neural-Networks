# Coloring black white images using Convolutional Neural Networks

Using self-made CNN combined with Inception classification model to color black/white images. Downsampling the image in inner layers of network to increase the features detected. Using already trained Inception model for image classification providing a global feature (i.e. the image class) to the model. Concatenating the two models together and upsampling after combination to obtain the input size image.
